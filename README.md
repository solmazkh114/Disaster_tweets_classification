# Disaster Tweets: A text clessification task

This project is among Kaggle competetion projects with aims to classify tweets into two classes: the one that are about a disaster and the one which are not. You can find the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nlp-getting-started/overview). We provided a Jupyter Notebook file contianing preprocessing, visualization, and feature extraction. we added some useful and meaningful features to the main dataset including number of words, number of sentences, a binary variable that indicates the tweet contians a specific type of pasrt of speech tagging or not, and a title generated by topic modelling techniques. For all of these new variables, we tested their relationship with the target feature using hypothesis testing. 

For vectorization, we tested three main vectorization techniques: Count Vectorize, TF_IDF and BOW. We also used Doc2Vec embedding techniques to keep the lexical relationship between words into account. 

The Notebook is self- contianed and a reader can get its process just by following cells.
